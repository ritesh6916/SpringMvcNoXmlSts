Java-Based Configuration for SpringMVC

Because we extended AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer
         Dispatcher servlet will be created Automatically, we are only providing the resources
         that is requred to create Dispatcher-Servlet Like:- BeansConfigrationFile (Also java-based)

Note:- this way of configuration is not recumended because it automate the creation and developer will have less conrol over it.

Thanks...
